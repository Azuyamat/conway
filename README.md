## Conway game of life[^1]

> Conway's Game of Life is a computer program that creates patterns using a grid of cells, kind of like a checkerboard. Each cell can be alive or dead. It follows these rules:

| Index | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation. |
| 2 | Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation. |
| 3 | Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation. |
| 4 | Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction. |

> Imagine starting with some living cells on the grid and then watching how they change with each "generation." It's like a simple computer game where patterns evolve over time based on these rules, creating interesting shapes and designs.
